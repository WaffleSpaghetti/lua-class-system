# lua class module with a complex number module implementation
a lightweight implementation of classes for lua, and a complex numbers module built on top of it <br>
the class system itself is 81 loc, but i also include 200+ loc of tests in the test suite (which also acts as example code, together with my complex numbers module) <br>
i hope that you'll enjoy my work :D <br><br>
