# lua-class-system with a complex number class implementation
a lightweight implementation of classes for lua. <br>
the system itself is 60 loc, but i also include 800+ loc of tests in both the old (and ugly) tests and the new and improved test suite (it also acts as example code, together with my complex numbers module) <br>
theres also a full complex number class implemented in the tests (with their own tests ofc) and a fractal renderer that works in roblox (though the system itself works everywhere, its written in plain lua)<br>
i hope that you'll enjoy my work :D <br><br>
in the last update i added an example of how you might create modules using this system and how to use them in UsecaseExample.lua! <br><br>
