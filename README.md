# lua-class-system with a complex number class implementation
a lightweight implementation of classes for lua. <br>
the system itself is 60 loc, but i also include 800 loc of tests and examples in tests.lua. <br>
theres also a full complex number class implemented in the tests (with their own tests ofc) and a fractal renderer that works in roblox (though the system itself works everywhere, its written in plain lua)<br>
i hope that you'll enjoy my work :D <br><br>
in the last update i added an example of how you might create modules using this system and how to use them in UsecaseExample.lua!
